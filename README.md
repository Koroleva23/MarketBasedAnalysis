# Market-Based Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive market analysis using Python and data science techniques. I explored customer segmentation through K-means clustering and performed Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Adjusted data types and formatting.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generated summary statistics.
   - Created visualizations to explore data distribution.

3. **Customer Segmentation (K-Means):**
   - Applied K-means clustering to segment customers.
   - Visualized customer clusters.
  
4. **Market Basket Analysis:**
   - Utilized the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.
   - Created a network graph to visualize item associations.

5. **Recommendations:**
   **i.** Product Placement:
     -Place 'Soda,' 'Whole Milk,' and 'Bottled Water' in close proximity in the store, as they form a strong association cluster.

   **ii.** Cross-Selling Opportunities:
       - Promote cross-selling of items within clusters.
     -'Vegetables' and 'Tropical Fruit' should be given to customers who purchase 'Whole Milk.'
      
 **iii.** Targeted Promotions:
        -Targeted promotions for items with strong associations should be created discounts can be offered  on 'Soda' when purchasing 'Rolls Buns' or 'Other Vegetables.'
        
   **iv.** Bundle Deals:
      -Introduce bundle deals that include items from the same cluster. say offer a bundle deal on 'Yogurt,' 'Whole Milk,' 'Other Vegetables,' and 'Rolls Buns.'
