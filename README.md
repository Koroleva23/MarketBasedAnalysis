# Market-Based Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive market analysis using Python and data science techniques. I explored customer segmentation through K-means clustering and performed Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Adjusting data types and formatting.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generating summary statistics.
   - Creating visualizations to explore data distribution.

3. **Customer Segmentation (K-Means):**
   - Applying K-means clustering to segment customers.
   - Visualizing customer clusters.

4. **Market Basket Analysis:**
   - Utilizing the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.
   - Creating a network graph to visualize item associations.

5. **Recommendations:**
   - Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
